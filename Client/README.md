# Client

This repository contains the client program for an E2EE chat application.

The program was made as part of an Object Oriented Analysis, Design and Implementation (OOADI) course at Aalborg University. 

The client can communicate with exactly one other client through the [server](https://gitlab.com/20gr552/ooadi/server).

It can run on the same machine as the server, or within the same network.

**To compile:**
user@user:~/client/$ make

**To run:**
user@user:~/client/$ make run

**To quit client program and close socket:**
**Cltr+C**

**To clean:**
user@user:~/client/$ make clean
